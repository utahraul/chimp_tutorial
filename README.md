Chimp is a testing framework that makes it super easy for developers to write automated tests, by taking away all the pain associated with setting up tools and allowing developers to focus on building-in quality. More in https://chimp.readme.io/

Chimp uses Cucumber, a framework for defining behavior using a language called Gherkin, so you can work with BDD (Behaviour Driven Develoment).
